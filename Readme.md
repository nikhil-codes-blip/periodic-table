- **Get Element by Atomic Symbol:** Input the atomic symbol (e.g., H, He, Li) to get its details.
- **Electronic Configuration (2D):** Displays the number of electrons in each shell.
- **Electronic Configuration (3D):** Displays the orbital-wise electronic configuration (e.g., 1s2 2s2 2p6...).
- **Element Properties:** Identifies whether the element is a metal, non-metal, or metalloid.
- **Handles Exceptions:** Correctly provides the electronic configuration for exceptional cases like Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu), and others.
